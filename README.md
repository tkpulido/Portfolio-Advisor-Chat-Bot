# Portfolio-Advisor-Chat-Bot
This is a simple chat bot that is meant to advise people up to the age of 65 on how to invest $5,000 or more.  It takes into account the user's risk level and makes provides a recommendation of how much to invest in stocks and bonds.  I have tested the code in AWS Lambda with four separate test cases, but I was unable to figure out how to get my bot to respond properly after linking it to my lambda function.

## Technologies
In order to build this chat bot you will need AWS Lambda and Amazon Lex.

## Usage
The chat bot will ask for name, age, the amount you wish to invest, and your level of risk (None, Low, Medium, or High).
